# What Would Vibe Coding Be If It Were Self-Aware?

## 📌 Project Summary
A working exploration of how AI can assist legal work without succumbing to hype, uncritical automation, or ethical oversights. The project uses insights from the *AI Snake Oil* corpus to guide prototype development of transparent, auditable, and philosophically rigorous tools.

## 🧱 Structural Layers

### 1. AI Snake Oil Enhanced Digest
- 18+ deeply analyzed themes from foundational papers (e.g., evaluation pitfalls, open model risk, prompt injection, civic governance)
- Includes legal task typology, transparency taxonomies, agent audit frameworks

### 2. Philosophical Framing
- Vibe coding described not as a formal method, but as a **subjective, exploratory process**
- Critical systems thinking + epistemic humility foregrounded
- Reflections on naming: “vibe coding,” “critical systems coding,” and alternate framings

### 3. Prototype Infrastructure
- `prototype_motion_assistant_logic.py`: motion draft scaffold with disclaimers, transparency logging, citation auditing
- `qa_checklist_llm_agent.md`: reusable evaluation rubric for legal AI tools
- `transparency_report_stub.md`: template for model documentation, aligned with transparency index and model cards
- `redteam_disclosure_policy.md`: lightweight safe-harbor-aligned disclosure framework
- `README.md` and `project_overview.md`: public-facing entry points for GitHub and collaborators

### 4. Documentation Artifacts
- Digest themes integrated with tool templates
- Working reflection section: *“What Vibe Coding Means (To Me)”*
- Scored, selected chat title: *“What Would Vibe Coding Be If It Were Self-Aware?”*

## 🔄 Methodology
- Every concept reviewed for source validity
- Primary source integration modeled after law review standards: each claim traced to publication, paper, or author intent
- Tools built around failure modes: hallucination risk, adversarial misuse, and prompt volatility all logged or sandboxed

## 📫 How to Use This
- Attach to your Gmail thread as a summary doc
- Paste sections into Google Docs for collaborative editing
- Use it to onboard new contributors, explain your work to legal funders, or establish trust with policy advisors
